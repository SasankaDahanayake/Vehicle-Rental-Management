# Vehicle-Rental-Management
This project is based on a vehicle rental system, covering up the prominent Object Oriented
Programming concepts. Additionally, I’ve pursued learning about Angular and Spring boot to
make this coursework. Along with Angular and Sprint boot, I’ve also used the technology of
MongoDB as it’s a more convenient and feasible database. Angular was used to design the
interface for the user, Spring Boot was used to collect the data from Java and MongoDB to a
front-end such as Angular. The UI was designed for the customer to look at the available vehicle
vehicles from the system which is operated by the manager. Manager updates the database with
the new vehicles or deletes them, allowing the customer to see the available vehicles and place a
schedule for each vehicle they prefer to use.
